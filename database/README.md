# ClassProject Open: database schema

[`schema.sql`](schema.sql) defines the **transactional database** of ClassProject Open, the global MOOC platform. It is a separate database from ClassProject's (`database/schema.sql` in the [cp repository](https://github.com/Techmawu-Solutions/cp)): the two platforms never share tables. They talk only through the signed partner API (spec section 25).

- **Target:** MySQL 8.0+ in production.
- **Check:** the file is verified by loading it into an empty MariaDB 10.11 database. It creates 146 tables and 295 foreign keys, plus 5 log tables partitioned by month.
- **Load it:**

```bash
mysql -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE classproject_open CHARACTER SET utf8mb4"
mysql -u root classproject_open < database/schema.sql
```

## Keeping it up to date

When a change adds, changes or removes something the platform stores, update all of these in the same change:

1. `schema.sql`: the table, its keys, and a comment on anything not obvious;
2. this README (the table groups below);
3. the spec, [`../ClassProject Open — Product Specification.md`](../ClassProject%20Open%20—%20Product%20Specification.md): the relevant section, section 0.1 status, and a Change Log row.

Then reload the file into an empty database to prove it runs, and drop that database.

## Conventions

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| `id BIGINT UNSIGNED` internal keys, plus a **`public_id CHAR(26)` ULID** on anything in a URL or the API | Fast joins; public IDs don't reveal counts and survive regional sharding (decision D5) |
| `tenant_id` on tenant-owned rows. **Tenant 1 is the public platform.** | Strict isolation (spec section 17) |
| **Users are global**: `memberships` give a user a role in a tenant | One person can learn publicly, study at a university, and train at work |
| Times are DATETIME in UTC. Money is `DECIMAL(12,2)` with an ISO-4217 currency | Global from day one |
| Index names: `ix_*` for plain indexes, `uq_*` for unique ones. Foreign keys are unnamed | Avoids name collisions between indexes and foreign keys (a real error on MariaDB) |
| Sensitive personal data (date of birth, guardian contact, payout details) is stored encrypted (`*_enc VARBINARY`) | Privacy of minors and financial data |
| The 5 append-only logs are partitioned by month and have **no foreign keys** | InnoDB doesn't allow foreign keys on partitioned tables; the app enforces integrity. A monthly job adds the next partition |

## The core chain in tables

The brief's chain, *Outcome → Competencies → Skills → Path → Activities → Practice → Assessment → Evidence → Credential*, maps to tables like this:

```mermaid
erDiagram
  goals ||--o{ goal_skills : targets
  careers ||--o{ career_competencies : requires
  competencies ||--o{ competency_skills : "made of"
  skills ||--o{ skill_prerequisites : "depends on"
  paths ||--o{ path_steps : has
  course_versions ||--o{ course_modules : contains
  course_modules ||--o{ lessons : contains
  lessons ||--o{ activities : contains
  activities ||--o{ activity_objectives : serves
  objectives ||--o{ objective_skills : develops
  items ||--o{ item_skills : assesses
  assessments ||--o{ attempts : "taken as"
  attempts ||--o{ item_responses : has
  users ||--o{ skill_mastery : "current estimate"
  users ||--o{ evidence : "observations (log)"
  credential_definitions ||--o{ credential_criteria : "requires"
  credential_definitions ||--o{ credentials : "issued as"
  credentials ||--o{ credential_evidence : "rests on"
  users ||--|| portfolios : owns
  portfolios ||--o{ portfolio_items : shows
```

- **Mastery flow:** an `item_responses`, `rubric_scores`, `activity_progress` or `live_poll_answers` row produces an **`evidence`** row, weighted by its source (spec section 15.3). A worker then updates **`skill_mastery`**: the probability of mastery and a state of *exposed*, *understood*, *applied* or *verified*.
- **Credentials:** when every `credential_criteria` row is met, a `credentials` row is created as *pending approval* or *active*. It is signed with an `issuer_keys` key, and its `credential_evidence` rows appear on the public verification page.

## The ClassProject link (spec section 25)

| Table | Role |
|---|---|
| `api_clients` | ClassProject's partner client: a public key and a hash of its signing secret. Its scope is `partner.recommendations` only |
| `partner_subject_mappings` | ClassProject catalogue subject code (e.g. `EMATH`) **in one country** (`country_code`, e.g. `GH`; ClassProject keeps a catalogue per country) and level band (e.g. `SHS1`–`SHS3`), mapped to Open skills, topics and that country's curriculum competencies |
| `courses.secondary_friendly`, `courses.min_age`, `courses.exam_alignment` | Decide which courses may be recommended to 13–17-year-olds |
| `partner_referrals` | Anonymous arrivals from `?ref=classproject&subject=…&level=…`, linked to a user only if they sign up |

**No ClassProject student identity is ever stored here** (decision D13).

## What isn't in this database

| Data | Where it lives |
|---|---|
| Search documents and vector embeddings (courses, transcripts, RAG chunks) | OpenSearch |
| Raw learning events older than 90 days, xAPI statements, video heartbeats, analytics marts | ClickHouse |
| Media bytes, uploads, credential PDFs, exports, offline packages | Object storage (rows hold the storage keys) |
| Private signing keys and provider secrets | KMS / vault |
| Sessions, cache, queues, rate limits | Redis (Laravel's own tables) |
