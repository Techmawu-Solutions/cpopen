# 1. PRODUCT VISION

Design a platform where the primary object is not the course.

The primary object is the:

**LEARNER OUTCOME**

A learner should be able to say:

> "I want to become a data analyst."

or:

> "I want to learn artificial intelligence."

or:

> "I want to become a school leader."

or:

> "I need to master Python."

The platform should then determine:

1. What the learner already knows
2. What competencies they need
3. What gaps exist
4. What learning experiences will close those gaps
5. What assessments should verify mastery
6. What projects should demonstrate capability
7. What credential/evidence the learner should receive

Therefore:

**Outcome → Competencies → Skills → Learning Path → Learning Activities → Practice → Assessment → Evidence → Credential**

---

# 2. CORE DIFFERENTIATION

Do not build another platform where:

> Search → Enroll → Watch videos → Take quiz → Get certificate.

Instead build:

> Diagnose → Personalize → Learn → Practice → Apply → Collaborate → Demonstrate → Master → Build Evidence → Advance.

Every major product decision should reinforce this model.

---

# 3. LEARNER PROFILES

Create rich learner profiles containing:

- Identity
- Education
- Professional background
- Current role
- Career goals
- Learning goals
- Existing skills
- Competency levels
- Learning preferences
- Languages
- Time availability
- Device capabilities
- Connectivity conditions
- Accessibility requirements
- Completed courses
- Assessment history
- Project history
- Portfolio
- Credentials
- Learning streak
- Mastery history

Do not reduce a learner to course completion percentages.

Build a **dynamic learner competency graph**.

---

# 4. AI LEARNING ORCHESTRATOR

Create an AI learning system that acts as a personal learning architect.

# 55. MOST IMPORTANT PRODUCT PRINCIPLE

The platform should answer three questions continuously:

### 1. What does the learner know?

### 2. What does the learner need to know?

### 3. Can the learner demonstrate that they know it?

Everything else should support these three questions.

The final product should combine:

**Open knowledge + structured learning + adaptive learning + human teaching + AI tutoring + community + practical projects + rigorous assessment + verifiable evidence.**

The goal is not to create the largest course library.

The goal is to create the platform on which a learner can most effectively move from:

**CURIOUS → KNOWLEDGEABLE → CAPABLE → COMPETENT → VERIFIED**

while retaining ownership of their learning data, portfolio and credentials.

Before writing production code, produce:

1. Product Requirements Document
2. Product vision and principles
3. Competitive gap analysis
4. User personas
5. User journeys
6. Information architecture
7. Functional requirements
8. Non-functional requirements
9. System architecture
10. Domain model
11. API architecture
12. Database architecture
13. AI architecture
14. Video/live architecture
15. Assessment architecture
16. Competency model
17. Credential model
18. Multi-tenancy model
19. Security architecture
20. Analytics architecture
21. UX architecture
22. MVP scope
23. Phase-by-phase roadmap
24. Engineering backlog
25. Acceptance criteria

Do not start implementation until the architecture and product requirements have been validated.
